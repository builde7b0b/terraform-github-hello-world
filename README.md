```
3. You can generate a token in settings of your Github Account

`terraform init`

terraform plan
terraform apply
```

`terraform destroy`

## setup 

### Google Cloud SDK
1. Install Google Cloud SDK: Install the Google Cloud SDK on your machine if you haven't already. You can follow the instructions here.

To install or remove components at your current SDK version [489.0.0], run:
  $ gcloud components install COMPONENT_ID
  $ gcloud components remove COMPONENT_ID

To update your SDK installation to the latest version [489.0.0], run:
  $ gcloud components update

The Google Cloud SDK installer will now prompt you to update an rc file to bring the Google Cloud CLIs into
 your environment.
 ```
  Enter a path to an rc file to update, or leave blank to use [/Users/yourname/.zshrc]:  
```
Installed Python 3.11 since gCLI uses that currently.

2. checkout to relevant branch 

3. Authenticate with GCP
```
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
```
- This will authenticate your Google account and set up credentials for Terraform to use

4. Create a GCP Project: If you don't have a project already, create a new one in the Google Cloud Console.
